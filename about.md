Hi! I'm munji, a Computer Software Engineer, Game Developer and 3D Artist from Mexico City. This site is a portfolio which includes the works Iâ€™ve contributed to or developed on my own, such as animation and modeling reels, games, as well as jam submissions. "munji" is the pseudonym I go by and what I publish my projects under, usually accompanied by the picture in the bottom left.
<br/>
<br/>
My primary skills are in 3D Character Animation, Modeling, Rigging and gameplay programming. I mainly use Blender, Unity and Unreal Engine, although I'm also knowledgeable about Maya and 3ds Max workflows.
<br/>
<br/>
While animation and game development are my strong suit, I'm also skilled in front-end development using a variety of languages and tools such as JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and Ruby (Jekyll).
