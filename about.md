Hi! I'm munji, a Software Engineer, Game Developer and 3D Animator from Mexico City. I'm currently working as an Animator and 3D Artist at Burning Boats Studios, a small indie development company I co-founded with a group of highly skilled developers from my home country.
<br/>
<br/>
This site is a portfolio which includes the works Iâ€™ve contributed to or developed on my own, such as animation and modeling reels, games and jam submissions. "munji" is the pseudonym I go by and what I publish my projects under, usually accompanied by the picture in the bottom left.
<br/>
<br/>
My primary skills are in 3D Character Animation, Modeling, Rigging and programming. I mainly use Blender and Maya for 3D stuff, and Unity and Unreal Engine for gamedev.
<br/>
<br/>
Although animation and game development are my strong suit, I'm also knowledgeable in front-end development using JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and Ruby (Jekyll).
